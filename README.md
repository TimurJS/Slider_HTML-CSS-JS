#Slider
___

This slider is created to serve as an option for future development of sliders in web applications or websites. Development of this slider involved the use of __HTML, CSS, and JS capabilities__. 

The slider is able to use an unlimited amount of images. To add an additional slide, a corresponding image must be placed into an images folder. Layout block __(".slide")__ then must be added with the image to the HTML file. It is also recommended to add a slide marker __(span ".dot")__ to indicate the added image. To move between slides, you can use the transition buttons or click on a specific marker under the slider.

This project also allows for an automatic slider transition animation. This is done by uncommenting an animation at the end of the _js/main.js_ file.
