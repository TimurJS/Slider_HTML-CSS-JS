Slider

This slider is created to serve as an option for future development of sliders in web applications or websites.
Development of this slider involved the use of HTML, CSS, and JS capabilities. 
The slider is able to use an unlimited amount of images. To add an additional slide, a corresponding image must be placed into an images folder. Layout block (".slide") then must be added with the image to the HTML file. It is also recommended to add a slide marker (span ".dot") to indicate the added image.
To move between slides, you can use the transition buttons or click on a specific marker under the slider.
This project also allows for an automatic slider transition animation. This is done by uncommenting an animation at the end of the js/main.js file.
